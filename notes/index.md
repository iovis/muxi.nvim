# TODO

- [ ] Add a `config` object
    - [ ] Holds `muxi_path`
- [ ] Add a `setup` function
- [ ] Add bookmark
- [ ] Go to bookmark
- [ ] ~Clear bookmarks for this project~
    - [ ] Clear everything too?
- [ ] Delete bookmark or just manage in popup?
    - [ ] Both?
- [ ] Popup with bookmarks?
    - [ ] not modifiable, similar to muxi's
    - [ ] `q` closes
    - [ ] `<cr>` go to file
    - [ ] `d` deletes?
    - [ ] `c|r` changes? What about conflicts?
    - [ ] Should I just map the keys to go to?
        - How to delete then? fzf-lua does `<c-x>`
- [ ] (Maybe for development) Show lua table for current project
    - [ ] Reset `muxi[cwd]` to the buffer contents before leaving the buffer
    - [ ] Can I prevent closing the buffer if the config is invalid?
- [ ] Update marks on buffer or vim leave?
